      <title>Internet Toolkit Website</title>
      <description>
	Melify Internet Toolkit is unlike what you have heard from others. It is a complete language around HTML; so you
	code at a much higher level than those TAGS you are used to. A common remote library allows you to completely
	separate applications from ever moving changes in the backend devlopment. You can easily connect to your database and
	run it on any Operating System. From MacOSX, Windows to any branch of unix. No other compnay can offer anything close to
	this.
