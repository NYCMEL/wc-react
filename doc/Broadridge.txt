Audit
 - pull out every current URL on your sites into a content matrix. I’d recommend investing in a scanning tool, like DeepCrawl,

 - Establish a Thorough 301 Redirect Map
 - Create a spreadsheet that contains every URL on your current website. You can divide your URLs into four groups:
   - Essential content
   - pages that you think are absolutely integral to your business
   - content that needs to be recreated on the new site
   - backlinks is a page that lots of other external websites think is good and are linking back to.
   - Content that has a lot of social shares or traffic from social media

 - Outdated or nonessential content that doesn’t have any links and doesn’t bring in traffic.
 - Content that has a lot of backlinks and/or social shares or that brings in a lot of organic traffic.
   - ontent that is resonating with your readers
 - Whatever is left
 
What are the SEO Best Practices When Merging Websites?
- Select a domain for the new website, preferably one that already has some link equity and authority
- Create a new information architecture for the website with a clear folder structure
- Perform a content audit on the outgoing sites, identifying all content that has link equity, content that generates traffic and conversions and important brand content
- Recreate important content in the new site
- Create 301 redirects directly from old content to new content
- Redirect inessential content to the homepage
- Leave redirects in place for nine months
- Create Google Search Console profile for new website and submit sitemaps
- Monitor any broken links and 404s in the Google Search Console after launching the new site
- If you leave duplicated content live on an old domain, apply a canonical URL to the old piece of
  content that tells search engines that the official version of this piece of content lives on the new website.
- Benchmark the performance of your old sites before you shut them down to measure the new site’s performance
